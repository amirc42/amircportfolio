Hello! My name is Amir Crutchfield. I am a recent computer science graduate that is eager to start my professional career. 
Currently based in the Washington D.C metro area I have an interest in software development as well as network engineering. 
I've worked a variety of jobs such as a store associate at Lidl and a help desk assistant for my university. I believe that 
this experience has given me the skills to solve problems in a creative fashion.
