Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project:
For this project we wanted to build an application that uses Twitter(X) data in order to build a 
sentiment analysis system. We created this by using some of the free APIs provided by Twitter.

<p>The way the program works is:
  - User enters a keyword into the search bar.
  - Using Twitter's search API the data related to that keyword is found such as certain
  phrases.
  - The sentiment dictionary within the program then assigns a score to the data found.
  - The score will fall into one of three categories: Positive, Negative or Neutral.
  - The results are then displayed in the GUI. </p>
