<pre> <h2> Group Projects That I Have Completed:</h2> 
Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project:
For this project we wanted to build an application that uses Twitter(X) data in order to build a 
sentiment analysis system. We created this by using some of the free APIs provided by Twitter.

<p>The way the program works is:
  - User enters a keyword into the search bar.
  - Using Twitter's search API the data related to that keyword is found such as certain
  phrases.
  - The sentiment dictionary within the program then assigns a score to the data found.
  - The score will fall into one of three categories: Positive, Negative or Neutral.
  - The results are then displayed in the GUI. 

  Future Works:
  - Cutting down the time for the sentiment analysis action to function.</p>

  

Stock Trading Program:
For this project we wanted to create a program that could run an algorithm that could buy
or sell stocks for the user.

<p>The way the program works is:
  - User enters a the set amount of cash that they wish to spend on stocks.
  - The user can then get the program to either buy, sell or implements range trading 
  on the available stocks.
  - The results of each action is then displayed in the GUI.
  - Stock prices are taken from Alpaca's API. 

  Future works:
  - The prices aren't always correctly updated which is something that will be improved on.
  - Users can't select what stocks they want to buy and sell individually, need to improve that. </p>
