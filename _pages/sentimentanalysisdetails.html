<pre><p>The way the program works is:
  - User enters a keyword into the search bar.
  - Using Twitter's search API the data related to that keyword is found such as certain
  phrases.
  - The sentiment dictionary within the program then assigns a score to the data found.
  - The score will fall into one of three categories: Positive, Negative or Neutral.
  - The results are then displayed in the GUI.

- This file shows some of the code for how we were able to connect to Twitter's API. In order to connect we needed to use the credentials provided to
  us by Twitter such as the API key, secret key and various tokens.

  This shows how we were able to gather data from twitter. We first gather the amount of tweets we want to find which in this case was 100. From
  there the Tweets are then filtered to remove things that aren't relevant to what we are searching for. Some of the things that are removed from
  example are emojis. The remaining relevant tweets are then saved to a file.

- This code shows how tweets are broken down in order to be analyzed. It also shows how the scores are created.

- This code shows how extensive our sentiment dictionary is. This is the dictionary that we used in order to calculate the sentiment scores of 
  certain phrases.

- This code shows the backend for how part of our GUI works. This section in particular shows how our method to create new users within the program
  works.

  <p>Future Works:
  - Cutting down the time for the sentiment analysis action to function.</p>
