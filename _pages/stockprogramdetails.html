The way the program works is:
  - User enters a the set amount of cash that they wish to spend on stocks.
  - The user can then get the program to either buy, sell or implements range trading 
  on the available stocks.
  - The results of each action is then displayed in the GUI.
  - Stock prices are taken from Alpaca's API. 

  Future works:
  - The prices aren't always correctly updated which is something that will be improved on.
  - Users can't select what stocks they want to buy and sell individually, need to improve that.
